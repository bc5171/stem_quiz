# STEM Quiz
Stem Quiz is an open source project that attempts to help teachers create online quizes for their students to take through a networked connected device. The end goal of this project is to make this easy enough to install on a Rasberry Pi.

STEM is mostly geared towards Science Technology Engineering and Math classes and will have some questions based around these topics. Although it should be said that this will allow functionality for other content areas.
